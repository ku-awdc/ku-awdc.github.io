	<h1>eggSim</h1>
	<p style="text-align:center">Page updated 29th November 2020</p>
	
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	<p>eggSim is an R package developed by Matt Denwood and Luc Coffeng to assess different survey designs for faecal egg count reduction tests, in terms of their cost efficiency, precision and expected statistical bias.  The code is open-source and freely available for use, although it is currently under active development so expect new features to be added over time.  We also welcome feedback and contributions to the project.
	
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	
	<h3>Installing R</h3>
	
	<p>Using the eggSim package currently requires installation and basic usage of the statistical programming software R - this is freely available from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN website</a>. In the future we hope to provide an online interactive tool to facilitate usage by practitioners without programming experience. Please feel free to contact us if you would be interested in using (or contributing to) a tool such as this.</p>
	
	<h3>Basic Usage</h3>
	
	<p>The simplest method of using eggSim is to install the pre-compiled package of the latest release version of the package from our Drat repopsitory.  Enter the following commands into R:</p>
	
	<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,Lucida Sans Typewriter,Lucida Typewriter,monospace; ">install.packages("eggSim", repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com/", "ku-awdc"="https://ku-awdc.github.io/drat/"))</p>
	
	<p>This should download and install the R package along with the required dependencies.  You can then launch an introductory vignette to help you get started with the package using the following code:</p>
	
	<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,Lucida Sans Typewriter,Lucida Typewriter,monospace; ">vignette("eggSim", package="eggSim")</p>
	
	<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
	
	<p>More advanced users may wish to use the development version of the R package directly from the <a href="https://github.com/ku-awdc/eggSim">GitHub repository</a>.  This can be installed using the following R code:</p>
	
	<p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,Lucida Sans Typewriter,Lucida Typewriter,monospace; ">remotes::install_github("ku-awdc/eggSim")</p>
	
	<p>Note that this does NOT install the vignettes by default.  Alternatively, you can also inspect the R code directly from the <a href="https://github.com/ku-awdc/eggSim">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

	<p>This article is currently under review at Clinical Infectious Diseases.  Version 0.9.0 of the eggCounts package was used to generate the results presented in this article, and all figures/tables are completely reproducible (with the same version of the package - see https://github.com/ku-awdc/eggSim/tree/master/releases for historical versions) using the "paper_outputs_v1.R" file available from:  https://github.com/ku-awdc/eggSim/tree/master/paper_2020</p>
