# ku-awdc.github.io

This is a public repository hosting the main web page for the AWDC section (https://ku-awdc.github.io)


## Editing

If you want to edit it then do the following:

1. Set up an account on https://github.com (if you have not done so already) and make a note of the username you have created

2. Email an admin (e.g. Carsten or Matt) and ask to be given write access to the website

3. Download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com

4. From inside GutHub Desktop, choose "File" then "Clone" and then type "ku-awdc/ku-awdc.github.io" (without the quotes) under filter.  Pay attention to the "Local Path" where this will be created (change the path to suit you).

5. Click the "Clone" button and wait a few seconds

6. Now open the folder with the repository in Windows/Finder (you can select Repository -> Show in Windows/Finder for a shortcut from inside GitHub Desktop)

7. Edit the webpage as needed either by directly editing the HTML or using a WYSIWYG editor (see the notes below for help).  Once you have finished, make sure you have saved your changes and close the files you are working on.

8. Go back into GitHub Desktop - you should now see your changes appear on the left.  Add a short comment (and optional description) below the list of changed files on the left.  Then click on 'Commit to Master' at the bottom, and then 'Push Origin' at the top right.

9. After a few minutes your changes should be live on the website (you may need to refresh the page in your browser).  Check your changes work as expected and re-edit the files if not (redo step 8 afterwards to commit your revised changes).

10. Next time you come to edit the page, first open GitHub Desktop and click on 'Fetch Origin' at the top right of the screen.  If somebody else has made a change then you will see the same button change to 'Pull Origin' - click this to syncronise their changes with your local copy before editing anything.  Once you have done this then repeat steps 6-9 to make your new changes.


## Using a WYSIWYG editor

Unless you are comfortable with editing HTML directly it is best to use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor to change the page content.  There are many of these available online and some of these are free e.g. [Blue Griffon](http://bluegriffon.org).  Find the folder containing the sub-page that you want to edit and then open the "index.html" file in your WHSIWYG editor.  Make your changes and save the file.  For relatively simple changes, including changing existing content or adding new content to an existing file, this is relatively straightforward.

For creating new pages and/or modifying the structure of the site it might be best to ask an admin familiar with the site structure (e.g. Matt) to help you.  Also bear in mind that the appearance of the pages (colours, font, heading sizes etc) is controlled for all pages simultaneously via a single CSS file - so you should focus on changing the content itself and check with an admin before making cosmetic changes that might affect the whole site.


## Editing the HTML files directly

You can do this if you wish but please ensure that the resulting files are valid XHTML.  There is a validator button at the bottom of each page:  it is a good idea to re-check this periodically when editing raw HTML to ensure that you have not made a mistake somewhere (note: this will always check the version of the site that is currently live so you do need to push your changes first).
