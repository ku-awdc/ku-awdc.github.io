# ku-awdc.github.io

This is a public repository hosting the main web page for the AWDC section (https://ku-awdc.github.io)

If you want to edit it then do the following:

1. Set up an account on https://github.com (if you have not done so already) and make a note of the username you have created

2. Email an admin (e.g. Carsten or Matt) and ask to be given write access to the website

3. Download and install GitHub Desktop from https://desktop.github.com

4. From inside GutHub Desktop, choose "File" then "Clone" and then type "ku-awdc/ku-awdc.github.io" (without the quotes) under filter.  Pay attention to the "Local Path" where this will be created (change the path to suit you).

5. Click the "Clone" button and wait a few seconds

6. Now open the folder with the repository in Windows/Finder (you can select Repository -> Show in Windows/Finder for a shortcut from inside GitHub Desktop)

7. Edit the webpage as needed either by directly editing the HTML or using a WYSIWYG editor (see below) and make sure you have saved your changes

8. Go back into GitHub Desktop - you should now see your changes appear on the left.  Add a short comment (and optional description) below the list of changed files on the left.  Then click on
